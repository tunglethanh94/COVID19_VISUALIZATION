    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a set of clear and accessible visualizations, together with interactive dashboards, based on the COVID-19 dataset from *Our World in Data*. We focus on showing how the pandemic unfolded across countries and continents, what role demographics played, and how vaccination progressed.  \n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Source: [Our World in Data – COVID-19 dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases)  \n",
    "- Scope: global coverage of COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing, hospitalizations, and vaccinations, enriched with demographic and economic indicators (population, life expectancy, GDP per capita, etc.).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Which countries have the largest populations?**  \n",
    "- **How do population size and life expectancy compare across countries?**  \n",
    "- **How did the number of cases and deaths grow over time in selected countries?**  \n",
    "- **Which countries vaccinated the highest share of their population?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dashboards then allow users to explore these questions interactively.\n",
